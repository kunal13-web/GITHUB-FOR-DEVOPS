GITHUB-FOR-DEVOPS

This repository is my practice lab for:
- Git basics (init, clone, add, commit, branches)
- Git hooks (pre-commit hook to block commits using BLOCK.txt)
- GitHub Actions (CI workflow to checkout code, list files, and print a message)

How to explore this repo:
- Check the commit history to see each experiment step by step.
- Look in .git/hooks/pre-commit to see the shell script for the hook.
- Look in .github/workflows/main.yml to see the GitHub Actions workflow.

Planned next steps:
- Add examples of advanced Git commands (stash, cherry-pick, reflog, bisect).
- Add Jenkins and Ansible examples for DevOps automation.
